## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Status & Security Notice

**üö® ALPHA SOFTWARE - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE üö®**

JVMXRay is currently in **alpha development status** and should **NOT be deployed in production environments**. This software is intended for testing, evaluation, and development purposes only.

**üìñ [Learn more about alpha limitations and security considerations ‚Üí](ZREADME-ALPHA.md)**

---

## Why JVMXRay?

Java applications are under constant attack, but traditional security tools require code changes, create performance overhead, or generate too many false positives. JVMXRay improves upon current state by:

- **Zero Code Changes**: Monitor any Java application without modifications
- **Intelligence Analysis**: AI enriches security events with contextual metadata for risk prioritization and compliance reporting
- **Complete Visibility**: See exactly what applications and dependencies are doing
- **Minimal Impact**: Low performance overhead using well-proven technologies like bytecode injection and Logback enterprise logging
- **Enterprise Ready**: Works with existing logging infrastructure and scales to any size

## Logging Philosophy: Beyond Traditional Approaches

### The Problem with Unstructured Logging
Traditional application logging relies on developers manually adding log statements throughout code. This creates several challenges:
- **Developer-Dependent**: Log quality varies based on individual experience and foresight
- **Needle in Haystack**: Complex parsing tools required to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text
- **Inconsistent Format**: Different developers use different logging patterns and message formats
- **Reactive Coverage**: Only logs what developers anticipated needing, missing unexpected security events

### JVMXRay's Structured Security Events
JVMXRay automatically generates structured security events without developer intervention:
- **System-Generated**: Consistent, comprehensive coverage regardless of developer experience
- **Machine-Readable**: Structured formats enable instant analysis and correlation without complex parsing
- **Predictive Coverage**: Monitors security-relevant operations automatically, capturing events developers might not anticipate
- **AI-Ready**: Structured data enables intelligent analysis, pattern recognition, and automated threat detection

## Who Benefits and How

### üè¢ Operations & IT Teams
- **Datacenter Intelligence**: Keep sensitive security data on-premises while leveraging AI analysis capabilities
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Monitor applications without restarts or maintenance windows
- **Alert Reduction**: Intelligent filtering significantly reduces security alert noise
- **Infrastructure Integration**: Works with existing Splunk, ELK, DataDog, and logging systems

### üë®‚Äçüíª Developers & Engineers  
- **Beyond Traditional Logging**: Eliminate dependency on manual log statements - JVMXRay automatically captures security-relevant operations in structured formats that don't require complex parsing tools to find security needles in log haystacks
- **AI Security Intelligence**: JVMXRay MCP Server provides event-based security intelligence to AI clients instantly, making them security experts on your datacenter. Compatible with Claude Desktop or internal MCP clients.
- **Improved Diagnostics**: Point-in-time system state capture with monitor sensor and uncaught exception handler to diagnose cloud server failures. Eliminates the need to recreate complex test environments for debugging production issues.
- **Real-time Insights**: See file access, network connections, and system calls as they happen

### üîí Security Practitioners
- **Advanced Threat Detection**: Machine learning enhances vulnerability identification accuracy
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: Automatic attack technique identification and timeline analysis
- **Incident Response**: Complete attack context with file, network, and process details
- **Low False Positives**: Context-aware detection based on actual application security events

### üìà Engineering Leaders & CISOs
- **Risk Reduction**: Proactive vulnerability detection prevents costly data breaches
- **Strategic Investment**: Comprehensive security monitoring that scales with business growth
- **Open Source Foundation**: No vendor lock-in with enterprise support options available
- **Supply Chain Security**: Monitor third-party libraries and detect malicious behavior
- **Compliance Automation**: AI-enriched security event data supporting compliance automation for SOC 2, PCI DSS, and regulatory reporting

# Deploying JVMXRay with Examples
The following provides some basic information to download and compile JVMXRay source on your computer.  Remainder of the video shows how to get JVMXRay working with Tomcat and work with Tomcat's examples.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in **under 5 minutes** with SQLite demo data and Claude Desktop AI integration:

1. **Change to GitHub Repository Folder**
   ```bash
   cd {your-github-folder}/
   ```

2. **Clone JVMXRay Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spoofzu/jvmxray.git
   ```

3. **Build JVMXRay Project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

4. **Generate Test Data**
   ```bash
   ./script/bin/data/generate-test-data
   ```
   **Note**: This script starts a program that executes various activities designed to stimulate JVMXRay Agent's sensors. When the script finishes, a SQLite database contains sensor data for experimentation.

5. **Migrate Data to Enriched Format**
   ```bash
   ./script/bin/data/migrate-stage-data
   ```
   **Note**: Migrate raw sensor events to enriched stage1 format for AI analysis and enhanced security intelligence.

6. **Optional: Generate API Key for MCP Integration**
   ```bash
   # Generate API key for Claude Desktop integration
   ./script/bin/security/generate-api-key "claude-desktop"

   # Start REST service (in separate terminal)
   ./script/bin/services/rest-service --port 8080
   ```

   **Configure Claude Desktop MCP:**
   Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop settings (replace `{YOUR_PROJECT_PATH}` with your actual project directory and use your generated API key):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "jvmxray": {
         "command": "java",
         "args": [
           "-jar",
           "{YOUR_PROJECT_PATH}/prj-mcp-client/target/prj-mcp-client-bridge.jar",
           "--host=localhost",
           "--port=8080",
           "--api-key={YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY}",
           "--debug=/tmp/jvmxray-mcp-debug.log",
           "--workers=4",
           "--queue=256"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   > **üí° Optional: Explore Test Database**
   >
   > SQLite test database¬π created at: `.jvmxray/common/data/jvmxray-test.db`
   >
   > Use any SQLite client to explore the test data:
   > ```bash
   > sqlite3 .jvmxray/common/data/jvmxray-test.db "SELECT * FROM STAGE0_EVENT LIMIT 10;"
   > ```
   >
   > **¬π** *SQLite is used for development and testing. Production deployments support MySQL and Cassandra databases.*

## How JMVXRay Works

1. **Deploy Agent**: Add JVMXRay as Java agent: `java -javaagent:xray.jar -jar yourapp.jar` - That's it! Your application won't know it's monitored.
2. **Sensor Installation**: Bytecode injection installs monitoring sensors automatically  
3. **Event Capture**: Sensors monitor file access, network connections, system calls
4. **AI Analysis**: Intelligence pipeline analyzes patterns and assigns vulnerability classifications
5. **Structured Event Generation**: Unlike traditional unstructured logs that require complex analysis tools, JVMXRay automatically generates machine-readable security events that enable instant analysis and AI enhancement
6. **Query & Analyze**: Generate reports with standard BI tools, visualize with Grafana dashboards, or answer ad-hoc queries using AI MCP clients connected to JVMXRay's MCP server  

### Enhanced MCP Query Capabilities ‚ú® **NEW**

JVMXRay's MCP server enables AI clients like Claude Desktop to become instant security experts on your datacenter. The system provides sophisticated querying capabilities with advanced filtering, pagination, and real-time analysis.
