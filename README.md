Itâ€™s designed with application security emphasis but some will also find it beneficial for software quality processes and diagnostics.

## Benefits
Following is a quick list of some of the more important benefits.

### :rocket: Identify protected resources
Track different types of events of interest related to sockets, files, process execution, and more.  When an event of interest occurs, process it as you wish.  At the moment, adaptors for the system console (e.g., System.out), logback, and Java Logging, are available with others in process. 

### :rocket: No code changes required
JVMXRay does not require any changes to your application source code to work.  The code is pulled into the JVM by a command line option.  The solution is 100% Java code so it runs anywhere.

### :rocket: Supply chain insights
An ancilary benefit of not requiring source code is that JVMXRay provides insight into your applications dependencies including 3rd party libraries (e.g. Jar files).  Events provide the source of origin where your classes where loaded when the event is generated.

### :rocket: Extensible & Open
Don't see an adapter or filter that works for you and know how to code?  Roll up your sleeves and write one.  It's extensible.  Fix a bug and submit a pull requrest.  All the source code is available.

```
INFORMATION:
Project under review for acceptance as an OWASP project. Please
consider this early stage code. 
Thar be dragons mate.  You were warned!
```

## Audience
The anticipated audience for JVMXRay is two-fold,<br/>

**Systems Administrators**
Individuals charged with system security and interested in new methods to gather security inteligence into Java applications.

**Security Developers & Architects**
Indiviudals interested in improved security intelligence about their applications.

# Deploying JVMXRay with Examples
The following provides some basic information to download and compile JVMXRay source on your computer.  Remainder of the video shows how to get JVMXRay working with Tomcat and work with Tomcat's examples.

# Sample Output...

The output from this technology can be presented in different ways.  The following is a small example of events captures using the JMX adaptor and uses the jconsole viewer that comes with Java.

What does the sample log output look like?  Output formats are flexible but following is small idea of what you can capture in a file.

```
CONSOLEADAPTOR 2020-02-24 14:13:28 PST PACKAGE_ACCESS,pkg=javax.crypto,stack=<disabled>
CONSOLEADAPTOR 2020-02-24 14:13:28 PST PERMISSION,n=getProperty.keystore.type.compat, a=, cn=java.security.SecurityPermission,stack=<disabled>
CONSOLEADAPTOR 2020-02-24 14:13:28 PST FILE_READ,f=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/security/cacerts,stack=<disabled>
CONSOLEADAPTOR 2020-02-24 14:13:28 PST PERMISSION,n=suppressAccessChecks, a=, cn=java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission,stack=<disabled>
CONSOLEADAPTOR 2020-02-24 14:13:28 PST PERMISSION,n=getProtectionDomain, a=, cn=java.lang.RuntimePermission,stack=<disabled>
CONSOLEADAPTOR 2020-02-24 14:13:28 PST PERMISSION,n=getProtectionDomain, a=, cn=java.lang.RuntimePermission,stack=<disabled>
CONSOLEADAPTOR 2020-02-24 14:13:28 PST SOCKET_CONNECT,h=192.30.255.112, p=443,stack=<disabled>
```
Some of the events appear duplicated since the console adaptor is a simplified output.

## How it Works
The Java Virtual Machine provides a robust security framework for controlling access to protected resources.  JVMXRay provides an implementation of the java.lang.SecurityManager component, called NullSecurityManager.  Ironically, the NullSecurityManager provides no policy enforcement but instead monitors activities to protected resources.  It's expected other cloud log processing tools, big data tools, or cloud secuirty tools will process these events into meaningful contextual information.
