## Why JVMXRay?

Java applications are under constant attack, but traditional security tools require code changes, create performance overhead, or generate too many false positives. JVMXRay improves upon current state by:

- **Zero Code Changes**: Monitor any Java application without modifications
- **Intelligence Analysis**: AI enriches security events with metadata like CWE/CVSS scoring for risk prioritization and compliance reporting
- **Complete Visibility**: See exactly what applications and dependencies are doing
- **Minimal Impact**: Low performance overhead using well-proven technologies like bytecode injection and Logback enterprise logging
- **Enterprise Ready**: Works with existing logging infrastructure and scales to any size

## Logging Philosophy: Beyond Traditional Approaches

### The Problem with Unstructured Logging
Traditional application logging relies on developers manually adding log statements throughout code. This creates several challenges:
- **Developer-Dependent**: Log quality varies based on individual experience and foresight
- **Needle in Haystack**: Complex parsing tools required to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text
- **Inconsistent Format**: Different developers use different logging patterns and message formats
- **Reactive Coverage**: Only logs what developers anticipated needing, missing unexpected security events

### JVMXRay's Structured Security Events
JVMXRay automatically generates structured security events without developer intervention:
- **System-Generated**: Consistent, comprehensive coverage regardless of developer experience
- **Machine-Readable**: Structured formats enable instant analysis and correlation without complex parsing
- **Predictive Coverage**: Monitors security-relevant operations automatically, capturing events developers might not anticipate
- **AI-Ready**: Structured data enables intelligent analysis, pattern recognition, and automated threat detection

## Who Benefits and How

### üè¢ Operations & IT Teams
- **Datacenter Intelligence**: Keep sensitive security data on-premises while leveraging AI analysis capabilities
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Monitor applications without restarts or maintenance windows
- **Alert Reduction**: Intelligent filtering significantly reduces security alert noise
- **Infrastructure Integration**: Works with existing Splunk, ELK, DataDog, and logging systems

### üë®‚Äçüíª Developers & Engineers  
- **Beyond Traditional Logging**: Eliminate dependency on manual log statements - JVMXRay automatically captures security-relevant operations in structured formats that don't require complex parsing tools to find security needles in log haystacks
- **AI Security Intelligence**: JVMXRay MCP Server provides event-based security intelligence to AI clients instantly, making them security experts on your datacenter. Compatible with Claude Desktop or internal MCP clients.
- **Improved Diagnostics**: Point-in-time system state capture with monitor sensor and uncaught exception handler to diagnose cloud server failures. Eliminates the need to recreate complex test environments for debugging production issues.
- **Real-time Insights**: See file access, network connections, and system calls as they happen

### üîí Security Practitioners
- **Advanced Threat Detection**: Machine learning enhances vulnerability identification accuracy
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: Automatic attack technique identification and timeline analysis
- **Incident Response**: Complete attack context with file, network, and process details
- **Low False Positives**: Context-aware detection based on actual application security events

### üìà Engineering Leaders & CISOs
- **Risk Reduction**: Proactive vulnerability detection prevents costly data breaches
- **Strategic Investment**: Comprehensive security monitoring that scales with business growth
- **Open Source Foundation**: No vendor lock-in with enterprise support options available
- **Supply Chain Security**: Monitor third-party libraries and detect malicious behavior
- **Compliance Automation**: Security event data enrichment supporting compliance like automatic CWE/CVSS scoring for SOC 2, PCI DSS, and regulatory reporting

## Quick Start

Get up and running in **under 5 minutes** with SQLite demo data and Claude Desktop AI integration:

1. **Change to GitHub Repository Folder**
   ```bash
   cd {your-github-folder}/
   ```

2. **Clone JVMXRay Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spoofzu/jvmxray.git
   ```

3. **Build JVMXRay Project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```
   **Note**: Test data is generated in a SQLite DB for JVMXRay unit tests. We also use the test data to demonstrate AI integration.


4. **Generate API Key for AI MCP Client (Claude Desktop)**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-api-key.sh
   ```
   **Note**: Paste JVMXRay MCP Server API key into your [MCP Client configuration for Claude Desktop](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10949351-getting-started-with-local-mcp-servers-on-claude-desktop).


5. **Start JVMXRay MCP Server**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start-mcp-server.sh
   ```

**That's it, you're up and running!** Try these sample phrases:
- *"Show me all critical security events from the last 24 hours"*
- *"Find network connections from IP 192.168.1.100 in the last hour"*
- *"Analyze SQL injection attempts and show attack patterns"*  
- *"Create a security timeline for the payment-gateway application"*
- *"Query ERROR level events from web-server app with limit 50"*

2. **Sensor Installation**: Bytecode injection installs monitoring sensors automatically  
3. **Event Capture**: Sensors monitor file access, network connections, system calls
4. **AI Analysis**: Intelligence pipeline analyzes patterns and assigns vulnerability classifications
5. **Structured Event Generation**: Unlike traditional unstructured logs that require complex analysis tools, JVMXRay automatically generates machine-readable security events that enable instant analysis and AI enhancement
6. **Query & Analyze**: Generate reports with standard BI tools, visualize with Grafana dashboards, or answer ad-hoc queries using AI MCP clients connected to JVMXRay's MCP server  

### Enhanced MCP Query Capabilities ‚ú® **NEW**

JVMXRay's MCP server enables AI clients like Claude Desktop to become instant security experts on your datacenter. The system provides sophisticated querying capabilities with advanced filtering, pagination, and real-time analysis.
